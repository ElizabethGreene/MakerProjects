# Savonius Turbine v4 -- Did not print

## Parameterized model

* Width 140mm
* AspectRatio = 1.5
* Overlap Percent = 0.14
* Height = Width * Aspect Ratio = 210mm
* BladeDiameter = (Width+Overlap) /2 = 79.8 mm
* BladeThickness = 0.8mm
* BaseplateThickness = 2.4mm
* NumberOfBlades = 2
* BaseRatio = 1.1
* BaseDiameter = Width * BaseRatio = 154 mm

Spiralized!  I had to increase the height and reduce the width slightly to keep the overhangs manageable
