# Savonius Turbine v3

## Parameterized model

* Width 150mm
* AspectRatio = 0.77
* Overlap Percent = 0.14
* Height = Width * Aspect Ratio = 115.50mm 
* BladeDiameter = (Width+Overlap) /2 = 85.5 mm
* BladeThickness = 0.8mm
* BaseplateThickness = 2.4mm
* NumberOfBlades = 2
* BaseRatio = 1.1
* BaseDiameter = Width * BaseRatio = 165mm
* ActualBladeHeight = Height - (BaseplateThickness * 0.5) = 116.5

I tried to add spiral to this but failed.  I did Parameterize the blade count, added a top plate, and notched it by half the thickness so the blades would lock in place when gluing.

Edit: Increase base thickness more and flip top plate to correct orientation.
