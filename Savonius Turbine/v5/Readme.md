# Savonius Turbine v5 - Straight, "combined eliptical" blade

* Width 150mm
* AspectRatio = 0.77
* Overlap Percent = 0.14
* Height = Width * Aspect Ratio = 210mm
* BladeDiameter = (Width+Overlap) /2 = 85.5 mm
* BladeThickness = 0.8mm*
* BaseplateThickness = 2.4mm
* NumberOfBlades = 2

In this model I moved fully to the mini top and bottom braces instead of endplates.  It also uses a "Combined Elliptical" blade design described in Sanusi 2017.

"Shaft Grippy thing" aka Screw mounted bearing support for 8mm shaft is new in this release. It allows mounting two turbines on the same shaft, but needs additional work.  There is insufficient clearance for mounting on the shaft and the thin bearing support section is fragile.  The bearing mount also needs work to reduce the screw spacing, increase the vertical height, increase the size of the bore, add a cutout to allow driving the bearing out.  I may undertake that, or begin rigidly mounting the turbines to the shaft and have the shaft rotate in a bearing instead.
