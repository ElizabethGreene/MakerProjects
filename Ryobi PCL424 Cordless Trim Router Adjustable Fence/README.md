## Printing and assembly

The model includes the required support material to print in this orientation.

After printing, optionally cut away the two strips of support material with a utility knife.  Then secure the fence to the router with two M8 bolts.  Finally, loosely install one M3 bolt or screw into the side of the fence.

## Using the tool

With the router off and battery removed, install a router bit in the tool.  Then install the fence as described above.  Adjust the fence to the desired position and tighten the M3 bolt or screw to lock it in place.  Optionally, a second M3 bolt or screw can be installed on the opposite side for additional holding power.

## Suggestions for future work

* Some small knobs on the M3 and M8 fasteners would make tool-less installation easier.
