This is a work in progress.

Design notes.

There are three designs.  The simplest design just mounts a depth micrometer body to the lathe ways.

The second has the knob fixed to the lead screw.

The third has the knob rotate on a leadscrew that's constrained against rotation but not constrained axially.
